# Task 2

Create a custom multilayer perceptron. 
It should contain 1 input layer that accepts all the pixels of the image (`input_size`) and a final layer, which outputs `num_classes` number of neurons.

First try to simply recreate Task 1 by giving your own value for the number of hidden neurons. Once that is successful, extend the network. Rather than 2 layers, make 3 or 4. Remember to add activation functions.

Only edit the sections below the `# <<< YOUR CODE HERE >>> #` comments in the `MyCustomMLP.py` file (but feel free to experiment).

To run and evaluate your network:
~~~
python main.py
~~~

Try to get an accuracy above 95%.
