Create a simple multilayer perceptron. It should contain 1 layer that accepts all the pixels of the image (`input_size`) and outputs to the hidden layer that contains `num_hidden_neurons` number of neurons. Finally, the hidden layer should output to the final layer, which has `num_classes` number of neurons.
